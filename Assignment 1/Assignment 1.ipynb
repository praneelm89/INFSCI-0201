If not, prompt user to enter a number again (until the user successfully enter one). Hint: You should use one of the loop structures we covered in the class.\n",
    "- Output the number of \"bucks\" (single dollar), \"sawbucks\" (10s), \"Benjamins\" (100) and \"grands\" (1000) corresponding to the amount entered by the user. For example if the user enters 7528, the program should output:\n",

    "### 2. Unscramble Words\n",
    "In this task, you will extend the anagram example reviewed in class to create a new Python program that could “unscramble” words. Word unscramblers are commonly used in word-based games such as Wordscapes, Scrabble, Wordle, and Words With Friends. You can review an online implementation of a word unscrambler at https://unscramblex.com/.\n",
    "Using code examples from class (e.g. the Anagram solver), create your own version of a word unscrambler. You can either use the input file provided in class, or you can find your own file that contains all the words in the English language.\n",
    "Unscrambled words refer to the process of rearranging the letters of a scrambled or jumbled word to form a meaningful word. Unlike anagrams, unscrambled words don't necessarily need to use\n",
    "all the original letters; the goal is to rearrange the letters to create a valid word. The resulting word may or may not be related to the original word. For example, given the scrambled word \"trca,\" unscrambling it can yield \"cart\" or \"car,\" both of which are valid words but not necessarily anagrams of each other."

    "    - Remove preceding and trailing spaces. Hint: there is a specific string function that does this for you.\n",

    "    - Remove duplicates. Hint: Convert your list to a set and back to a list. Google this to find out how you can create a set from a list and vice versa.\n",

    "    - Make sure that the user entered an input has at least 3 characters. If the user entered less than 3 characters, ask them to re-enter (until they provide a valid input). If the input is longer than 6 characters, just take the first 6 characters (Hint: use string slicing)\n",
